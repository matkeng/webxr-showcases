# Drawing Workbench — hello-world proof of concept

A minimal, end-to-end slice of the *Drawing Workbench* architecture, built to
prove the stack installs and runs as a Windows `.exe`:

```
Tauri 2 shell (Rust, WebView2)
 ├─ Vue 3 + TypeScript + Pinia front end      web/
 └─ Python engine sidecar (Nuitka-compiled)   desktop/engine/  →  FastAPI on 127.0.0.1:<free port>
      └─ workbench_core (no web framework)    core/
```

What it demonstrates:

| Spec item | In this PoC |
|---|---|
| §3 Tauri 2 shell, NSIS `Setup.exe` + MSI, WebView2 bootstrapper bundled | `desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` |
| §3 Python sidecar compiled with Nuitka, launched on a free port, stopped on exit | `desktop/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`, `desktop/engine/` |
| §5 Framework-free `workbench_core` with a thin FastAPI adapter | `core/`, `desktop/engine/workbench_desktop/app.py` |
| §4 Vue 3 + Pinia shared store | `web/src/stores/workbench.ts` |
| §7 Pydantic document model with stable UUIDs | `core/src/workbench_core/model.py` |
| §12 GitHub Actions build on `windows-latest` | `.github/workflows/drawing-workbench-windows.yml` |

The window shows engine status (port, Python version, whether it's
Nuitka-compiled, PID), a "say hello" round-trip to Python, and a few demo
model objects.

## Getting the Windows installer

**Easiest: from CI.** Every push touching `drawing-workbench/` runs the
*Drawing Workbench - Windows build* workflow. Open the run in the repo's
**Actions** tab and download the `drawing-workbench-windows` artifact. It contains:

- `Drawing Workbench_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe` (NSIS installer)
- `Drawing Workbench_0.1.0_x64_en-US.msi` (for silent/IT deployment: `msiexec /i <file>.msi /qn`)

The builds are **unsigned**, so SmartScreen will say "Windows protected your
PC": click *More info → Run anyway*. Code signing (spec §3) is a later step.

**Locally on Windows.** Install Python 3.11+, Node 20+, Rust (`rustup`, MSVC
toolchain) and Visual Studio Build Tools with the C++ workload, then:

```powershell
pwsh drawing-workbench/scripts/build-windows.ps1
```

Installers land in `desktop/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/{nsis,msi}/`.
The first Nuitka build takes several minutes; later builds are cached.

## Development

```powershell
# 1. Build the sidecar once (Tauri checks the binary exists even in dev).
pwsh drawing-workbench/scripts/build-engine.ps1     # or scripts/build-engine.sh on macOS/Linux

# 2. Run the desktop app with hot reload (starts Vite for you).
cd drawing-workbench/web; npm install
cd ../desktop; npm install; npx tauri dev
```

Front-end only, in a browser, against an interpreted engine:

```bash
cd drawing-workbench
python -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e core -e desktop/engine   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\pip
.venv/bin/python -m workbench_desktop --port 8765
cd web && npm install && npm run dev        # open http://localhost:5173
```

## Things to check on a Windows test machine

- Installs per-user without admin (NSIS) and silently via MSI.
- First launch: engine connects (status turns green). The connect time
  includes Nuitka onefile extraction and any antivirus scan; note it.
- Closing the window leaves no `workbench-engine.exe` in Task Manager.
  (The engine also watches the shell's PID and exits if the shell dies.)
- If the engine never connects, check `%TEMP%\workbench-engine.log`.
